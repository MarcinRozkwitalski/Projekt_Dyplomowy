# Projekt_Dyplomowy
## Three-person engineering project with a consultant from another university. 
## Point & Click game combining computer science and psychology. 
Our collaborative approach included weekly progress reviews where we shared our work and received valuable insights, enriching the project with diverse perspectives and expertise. 

In this game, player answers questions with affirmative or negative responses, and at the end, receives a personality score and a suggested career path. 

I contributed by programming statement scenarios, implementing the Rock Paper Scissors mini-game, creating 2D graphics, creating rigging and animating 2D humanoid characters using the Inverse Kinematics system, and co-managing project documentation.
